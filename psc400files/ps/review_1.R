## you have to write code below every line that starts with #. Lines that start with ## provide explanations


## R as a calculator

# Use the + sign to add 5 and 3


# Use the - sign to subtract 3 from 5


# Use the / to divide 6 by 2


# set the sqrt() function to take the square root of 16


## Storing results

# create an object called mydiff that contains 8-1


# Print the value of mydiff to the console



## Characters and strings

# First, save the text "social science" to the variable course


# Next, save the text "learning R" to the same variable course


# Finally, print the value of course to the console. What do you think it will say?



## Copying and reassigning variables

# execute the line below to create the object result
result <- 8 - 2

# Assign the value of result to result2


# Overwrite the value of result with 10 - 2


# print result




### Working with Data

# Load the data frame UNpop from the file UNpop.csv


## The data provides the world population (in thousands) per year 

# Print the UNpop data frame


# Print the variable names of UNpop


## Print the dimensions of UNpop


# Print the number of observations (rows) in this data frame


# Print the number of variables (columns) in this data frame


# print out the world.pop variable using $


# calculate the mean world population over this time period


# print out the world.pop variable for the years 1980 and later (greater or equal to in R: >=; greater than: >)


# calculate the mean world population for the years 1980 and later
