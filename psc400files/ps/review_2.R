# clear the workspace

# load the resume.csv data

# create a cross tab of the sex and call variables in the resume data.

# create a subset of the resume data frame that is only female names that sound white. Save this subset as resume.wf

# Calculate the mean of the call variable in this subset.

# Create a subset of the resume data for black-sounding female names

# Print the difference in means between the call variable in the white-sounding name subset and the black-sounding name subset.

# Use the ifelse function to create a new variable called carrie that is 1 if the resume name (firstname) is "Carrie" and 0 otherwise.

# calculate the mean of the call variable for all observations where the carrie variable is 1



# clear the workspace

# load the star.csv data

# Try to calculate the mean of the math variable in the star data frame without setting na.rm.

# Try to calculate the mean of the math variable with setting na.rm.

# Use the table function to create a vector of counts (called classcounts) for each category of the classtype in the star data.

# create a barplot using the classcounts object

# make the barplot nice in the ways discussed in class

# Use the hist function to create a histogram for the g4math variable in the star data frame. Be sure to use the freq = FALSE argument to the hist function to get the histogram

# make the histogram nice in the ways discussed in class

# Create a scatter plot with g4math on the x-axis and g4reading on the y-axis, both from the star data

# make the scatter plot nice in the ways discussed in class
