# Create a scatter plot with g4math on the x-axis and g4reading on the y-axis, Make the scatter plot nice in the ways discussed in class.

# Use the abline function to add a vertical line at the mean of the math variable. Remember, there are missing values in that variable so be sure to use the na.rm = TRUE argument to drop them.


# Use the text function to add "Average Math Score" to the plot at the point (x=750, 0.014)

# Add a horizontal line at the mean of the reading variable.



# Create a scatter plot with g4math on the x-axis and g4reading on the y-axis, but only for students where classtype is regular (plot those points in black). Make the scatter plot nice in the ways discussed in class

# add, in red, the points for students where classtype is small


# Add vertical lines at the means of the math variable for the students in a regular class (in black) and the students in a small class (in red).

# Add horizontal lines at the means of the reading variable for the students in a regular class (in black) and the students in a small class (in red).
