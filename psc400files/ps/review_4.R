# clear the workspace

# load the qog_bas_cs_jan24.csv data


# create a table of the variable p_polity2


# create a new variable p_polity2_cat that has the value "Autocracy" if p_polity2 is -6 or lower, "Anocracy" if p_polity2 is between -5 and 5, and "Democracy" if p_polity2 is 6 or higher.

# compute the mean value of top_top10_income_share for countries that are autocracies

# compute the mean value of top_top10_income_share for countries that are anocracies

# compute the mean value of top_top10_income_share for countries that are democracies

# create a new variable called nelda_mbbe_2 that has the same values as nelda_mbbe

# then, in nelda_mbbe_2, change the observations that have a value of 3 to having a value of 0.5

# do the two last two steps for the variables nelda_mtop, nelda_oa, and nelda_rpae as well

# create a variable nelda_index that is the average of nelda_mbbe_2, nelda_mtop_2, nelda_oa_2, and nelda_rpae_2


# finally compute the mean valaues of nelda_index for autocracies, anocracies, and democracies
