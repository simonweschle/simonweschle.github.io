# load the quality of government dataset (qog_bas_cs_jan22.csv)

# from the variable p_polity2, create a new variable called democracy that takes the value of 1 if p_polity2 is 6 or larger, and zero otherwise (codebook: https://www.qogdata.pol.gu.se/data/codebook_bas_jan22.pdf)

# The outcome variable of interest is female literacy rate (wdi_litradf). compute the difference-in-means of wdi_litradf between democracies and non-democracies

# Run a regression of wdi_litradf on democracy. Save the regression to the object fit and print that object.




# The dependent variable is female literacy rate (wdi_litradf), and our main indepednent variable is 


# Now, add the variable vdem_gender (Women political empowerment index) as an additional control variable to the regression (saving it as fit_2var) and print that new model.


# finally, add two more variables of your choice as additional controls to the regression (saving it as fit_4var) and print that new model.
