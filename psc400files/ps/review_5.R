data <- data.frame(x,y)

# Regress y on x (ie y is DV, x is IV) and assign it to an object called fit 

# print fit 

# create a scatterplot of x and y

# add the fitted regression line

# based on the regression, what are the predicted y-values for each observation? Print the vector of predicted values

# what is the model fit (R2)?


## let's say the observations above are students, y is the number of points they receive in the final exam, and x is the number of points they receive in the midterm

# Write a sentence that explains how we can interpret the intercept

# Write a sentence that explains how we can interpret the slope coefficient
